# Introduction

---

## The Romance language family

- includes: Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan, French, Italian, Romanian and others
- branch of Indo-European
- name comes from Latin word *romanice* 'in the Roman way'
- descended from Latin after the fall of the Roman Empire

---

## Historical context

- when the Romans conquered the eastern Mediterranean, it was already urbanized and Greek-speaking
- the Romans left this state of affairs alone, and as a result Latin was widely spoken only in the western half
- in the third century, the empire fell into crisis in part because it was so huge
- starting with Diocletian (284--305 CE), the east and west started to be administered more and more separately
- the western half of the empire fell in 476 CE, leaving the Latin-speaking people no longer united under a single state
- the eastern half kept going until 1453 CE as what we now know as the Byzantine Empire

## Classical and Vulgar Latin

- normally when we think of Latin, we think of the language Caesar, Cicero, Virgil wrote in
  - we call this **Classical Latin** (CL)
  - but this is actually one particular *sociolect* of the language
- a **sociolect** is a variety of a language that is determined by socio-economic status
  - like a dialect, but varies by class instead of region
- the common people spoke very differently, even from the days of the Roman Republic (509--27 BCE)
  - we call the way the common people spoke **Vulgar Latin** (VL)
  - from *vulgus* 'common people'

---

## The decline of Classical Latin

- two factors in the fall of CL as a living language:
  - as the western empire declined, standards of education slipped 
  - with the rise of Christianity, the desire to preach widely led to an emphasis on language that could be understood by the common people
- CL, the prestigious variety of the educated Romans, remained as a written language

---

## The fragmentation of Vulgar Latin

- VL was never uniform across the western empire
- a single government helped communication and travel, so the dialects remained similar
- after the western empire fell (476 CE), communication among Latin speakers became much harder
- the varieties of Latin spoken in the regions of the former western empire continued to diverge from the written standard of CL, and from each other
  - by 800 CE, the different regional varieties of VL were distinct enough to be considered separate languages

---

## Classical vs Vulgar Latin: Introduction

- anyone who has studied CL can list the many ways in which it differs from Romance languages in:
  - vocabulary (e.g. *equus* 'horse' not *caballus*)
  - morphology (e.g. genitive case for possession, not *de*)
  - syntax (e.g. subject-object-verb word order)
  - phonology (e.g. *cīvis* /kiːwis/ not /sivis/ or /tʃivis/)
- VL is much more like the Romance languages in all these respects

---

## Caveats

- this picture of VL is adequate to describe Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Italian
- some Romance languages incorporate features of an earlier version of VL:
  - Romanian descends from a version of VL with a nine-vowel system including /ɪ ʊ/
  - Sardinian descends from an even earlier version, which distinguished long and short /a/
- so NB: this is not the complete picture, but it will help you get your bearings in Romance historical linguistics

## Pitch accent and stress accent

- VL, like all the Romance languages (and English), had a **stress accent**
  - **stress accent**: accented syllable has greater emphasis
  - the realization of this emphasis differs in different languages
  - could be: louder, longer, higher/lower pitch
- CL (perhaps under the influence of Greek) may have had features of **pitch accent**
  - **pitch accent**: accented syllable is higher pitch
- traditionally, scholars have understood the changes in VL's vowel system in terms of a the switch from pitch accent to stress accent
  - now this is controversial but plausible
  - stress accent emphasises the difference between accented and unaccented syllables
  - this often leads to loss of unstressed vowels, which we will see in VL

---

## Final *-m*

- preliminary note about CL words ending in *-m*
- this was not the consonant /m/, but rather a marker of nasalization on the preceding vowel
  - one way we we know this is from the rules of Latin poetry
  - if one word ended in a vowel, and the next began in a vowel, Roman poetry ran the two together and counted them as one syllable
  - Roman poetry also treated final *-m* in this way, indicating that words written with final *-m* still in fact ended in a vowel
- so *imperium Rōmānum* 'Roman empire' represented CL /im.ˈpe.ri.ũ roː.ˈmaː.nũ/ 
- VL lost this nasalization, so there was no distinction between words ending in a vowel and *-m* and those ending in the plain vowel 
  - this removes the distinction between nominative and accusative in some noun declensions
  - *rēgīna* 'queen (nominative)' vs *rēgīnam* 'queen (accusative)' are pronounced the same in VL

---

## CL vs VL vowel system

- CL vowel system: five vowels with contrastive length
  - long vowels spelled with macron (e.g. *ā*) in modern Latin orthography
  - plus diphthongs: /ai au oi/

| Front | Mid  | Back   |
|-------|------|--------|
| i iː  |      | u uː   |
| e eː  |      | o oː   |
|       | a aː | &nbsp; |

- VL vowel system: seven vowels, no contrastive length

| Front | Mid | Back   |
|-------|-----|--------|
| i     |     | u      |
| e     |     | o      |
| ɛ     |     | ɔ      |
|       | a   | &nbsp; |
