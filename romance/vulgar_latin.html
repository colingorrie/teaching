# Vulgar Latin

## Phonology

Colin Gorrie, Ph.D.  

---

## Before we begin

- Vulgar Latin doesn't mean rude Latin
- it's the name of the variety of Latin that the Romance languages came from
- Vulgar Latin is quite different from Classical Latin (the Latin people study in school)
  - we'll look at how these differences give the Romance languages their shared characteristics
- today: the sound system of Vulgar Latin

---

## Before we begin

- I assume you know the basics of phonetics and phonology
  - places and manners of articulation
  - the International Phonetic Alphabet
  - the basic idea of phonological processes
- if not, check out the links in the description
- some familiarity with Classical Latin or a Romance language will help too, although it's not strictly necessary

# Introduction

---

## The Romance language family

- includes: Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan, French, Italian, Romanian and others
- branch of Indo-European
- name comes from Mediaeval Latin word *rōmānicē* 'in the Roman way'
- descended from Latin after the fall of the Roman Empire

---

## Historical context

- Roman empire surrounded Mediterranean, extended up through modern France and England
- but only the western half spoke Latin
  - when the Romans conquered the eastern Mediterranean, it was already urbanised and Greek-speaking
  - the Romans left this state of affairs alone, and had effectively a bilingual empire
- in the third century, the empire fell into crisis in part because it was so huge
- starting with Diocletian (284--305 CE), the east and west started to be administered more and more separately
- the western half of the empire fell in 476 CE, leaving the Latin-speaking people no longer united under a single state
- the eastern half kept going until 1453 CE as what we now know as the Byzantine Empire

## Classical and Vulgar Latin

- normally when we think of Latin, we think of the language Caesar, Cicero, Virgil wrote in
  - we call this **Classical Latin** (CL)
  - but this is actually one particular *sociolect* of the language
- a **sociolect** is a variety of a language that is determined by socio-economic status
  - like a dialect, but varies by class instead of region
- the common people spoke very differently, even from the days of the Roman Republic (509--27 BCE)
  - we call the way the common people spoke **Vulgar Latin** (VL)
  - from *vulgus* 'common people'

---

## The decline of Classical Latin

- two factors in the fall of CL as a living language:
  - as the western empire declined, standards of education slipped 
  - with the rise of Christianity, the desire to preach widely led to an emphasis on language that could be understood by the common people
- CL, the prestigious variety of the educated Romans, remained as a written language

---

## The fragmentation of Vulgar Latin

- VL was never uniform across the western empire
- a single government helped communication and travel, so the dialects remained similar
- after the western empire fell (476 CE), communication among Latin speakers became much harder
- the varieties of Latin spoken in the regions of the former western empire continued to diverge from the written standard of CL, and from each other
  - by 800 CE, the different regional varieties of VL were distinct enough to be considered separate languages

---

## Classical vs Vulgar Latin: Introduction

- anyone who has studied CL can list the many ways in which it differs from Romance languages in:
  - phonology (e.g. *cīvis* /kiːwis/ not /sivis/ or /tʃivis/)
  - morphology (e.g. genitive case for possession, not *de*)
  - syntax (e.g. subject-object-verb word order)
  - vocabulary (e.g. *equus* 'horse', not whatever gave birth to Sp. *caballo*, Fr. *cheval*)
- VL is much more like the Romance languages in all these respects

---

## Caveats

- this picture of VL is adequate to describe Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Italian
- some Romance languages incorporate features of an earlier version of VL:
  - Romanian descends from a version of VL with a slightly different vowel system
  - Sardinian descends from an even earlier version, which distinguished long and short /a/
- so NB: this is not the complete picture, but it will help you get your bearings in Romance historical linguistics

# Phonology

## Pitch accent and stress accent

- VL, like all the Romance languages (and English), had a **stress accent**
  - **stress accent**: accented syllable has greater emphasis
  - the realisation of this emphasis differs in different languages
  - could be: louder, longer, higher/lower pitch
- CL (perhaps under the influence of Greek) may have had features of **pitch accent**
  - **pitch accent**: accented syllable is higher pitch
- traditionally, scholars have understood the changes in VL's vowel system in terms of a the switch from pitch accent to stress accent
  - now this is controversial but plausible
  - stress accent emphasises the difference between accented and unaccented syllables
  - this often leads to loss of unstressed vowels, which we will see in VL

---

## Final *-m*

- preliminary note about CL words ending in *-m*
- this was not the consonant /m/, but rather a marker of nasalisation on the preceding vowel
  - one way we we know this is from the rules of Latin poetry
  - if one word ended in a vowel, and the next began in a vowel, Roman poetry ran the two together and counted them as one syllable
  - Roman poetry also treated final *-m* in this way, indicating that words written with final *-m* still in fact ended in a vowel
- so *imperium Rōmānum* 'Roman empire' represented CL /im.ˈpe.ri.ũ roː.ˈmaː.nũ/ 
- VL lost this nasalisation, so there was no distinction between words ending in a vowel and *-m* and those ending in the plain vowel 
  - this removes the distinction between nominative and accusative in some noun declensions
  - *rēgīna* 'queen (nominative)' vs *rēgīnam* 'queen (accusative)' are pronounced the same in VL

---

## CL vs VL vowel system

- CL vowel system: five vowels with contrastive length
  - long vowels spelled with macron (e.g. *ā*) in modern Latin orthography
  - plus diphthongs: /ai au oi/

|          | Front | Central  | Back   |
|---------:|-------|----------|--------|
| **High** | i iː  |          | u uː   |
| **Mid**  | e eː  |          | o oː   |
| **Low**  |       | a aː     | &nbsp; |

- VL vowel system: seven vowels, no contrastive length

|               | Front   | Central | Back   |
|--------------:|---------|- -------|--------|
| **High**      | i       |         | u      |
| **Mid-Close** | e       |         | o      |
| **Mid-Open**  | ɛ       |         | ɔ      |
| **Low**       |         | a       | &nbsp; |

---

## Vowel contrasts by position

- stressed vowels and diphthongs

|        |    |         |      |      |   |         |    |
|--------|----|---------|------|------|---|---------|----|
| **CL** | iː | i eː oi | e ai | a aː | o | oː u au | uː |
| **VL** | i  | e       | ɛ    | a    | ɔ | o       | u  |

- unstressed vowels and diphthongs

|        |    |              |      |           |    |
|--------|----|--------------|------|-----------|----|
| **CL** | iː | i eː e oi ai | a aː | o oː u au | uː |
| **VL** | i  | e            | a    | o         | u  |

  - /i e ɛ a o ɔ u/

- in unstressed syllables, VL has a **five-vowel** system
  - /i e a o u/
  - no contrast between mid vowels /e ɛ/ and /o ɔ/

---

## Solving a Spanish mystery

- Why do verbs like *tener* 'to have' change their vowels in some forms?
  - *t.emph[e]nemos* 'we have' vs *t.emph[ie]ne* 'he/she/it has'
- stress differences in CL/VL
  - CL *tenēmus* /t.emph[e]ˈneːmus/ 'we hold' → VL /t.emph[e]ˈne.mos/

- CL *colōrem* /k.emph[o]ˈloː.rẽ/ 'colour' → VL /k.emph[o]ˈlo.re/
  - It. *colore*, Sp. *color*, Po. *côr*, Fr. *couleur*

---

## Deletion of unstressed vowels (syncope)

- **syncope**: deletion of a sound
- many unstressed CL vowels are deleted in VL
  - only CL /a aː/ is never deleted in this way
  - vowels in word-initial or word-final syllables always survived this syncope
  - otherwise, open season!
- this creates many new consonant clusters in VL, which each Romance language dealt with differently

---

## Syncope after stress

- CL *oculum* /ˈo.k<span class="emph">u</span>.lũ/ 'eye' → VL /ˈɔ.klo/
  - It. *occhio*, Sp. *ojo*, Po. *olho*, Fr. *oeil*
- CL *fēminam* /ˈfeː.m<span class="emph">i</span>.nã/ 'woman' → VL /ˈfem.na/
  - It. *fémmina*, Sp. *hembra*, Po. *fêmea*, Fr. *femme*

---

## The fate of CL /h/

- CL /h/ simply disappeared in VL
- these words are often still written with an *h* in modern languages, under the influence of CL
 
- CL *herbam* /ˈ.emph[h]er.bã/ 'grass' → VL /ˈɛr.ba/
  - It. *erba*, Sp. *hierba*, Po. *erva*, Fr. *herbe*

---

## Labial reorganisation: CL /w -b-/

- CL /w/ became VL /β/ (maybe /v/ in some regions)
- CL /b/ became VL /β/ (ditto /v/):
  - between vowels
  - after a vowel and before the liquids /l r/

---

### CL /w/ → VL /β/

- CL *vītam* /ˈ<span class="emph">w</span>iːtã/ 'life' → VL /ˈ<span class="emph">β</span>i.ta/
  - It. *vita*; Sp., Po. *vida*; Fr. *vie*

### CL /-b-/ → VL /β/

- CL *habēre* /haˈ<span class="emph">b</span>eː.re/ 'to have' → VL /aˈ<span class="emph">β</span>e.re/
  - It. *avere*, Sp. *haber*, Po. *haver*, Fr. *avoir*

---

## The fate of the CL approximant /j/

- the sound spelled *i* could represent either the vowel /i/ or the consonant /j/ in CL
- it represented a consonant /j/ only:
  - word-initially: *iam* /jam/ 'already'
  - or between vowels: - *māior* /maːjjor/ (note the doubling or *gemination*)
- this CL /j/ became a fricative: VL /ʝ/ (maybe /ʒ/ in some regions)
  - don't confuse this with the VL /j/ that came about by de-syllabifying the *i* in words like *uncia* (see below)

---

### CL /j/ → VL /ʝ/

- bonus change: CL /i/ → VL /j/ when preceding a vowel
- CL *iūnium* /ˈ<span class="emph">j</span>uː.n<span class="emph">i</span>.ũ/ 'June' → VL /ˈ<span class="emph">ʝ</span>u.n<span class="emph">j</span>o/ → /ˈʝu.ɲo/
  - It. *giugno*, Sp. *junio*, Po. *junho*, Fr. *juin*

### CL /-jj-/ → VL /ʝʝ/

- CL *māiōrem* /maː<span class="emph">jˈj</span>oː.rẽ/ 'June' → VL /ma<span class="emph">ʝˈʝ</span>o.re/
  - It. *maggiore*, Sp. *mayor*, Po. *mór*, Fr. *majeur*
---

## Emergence of VL /j/

- CL /i e/ represented full vowels, not approximants, even when **in hiatus**
- **in hiatus**: when a vowel precedes another vowel
  - e.g. *uncia* /ˈun.ki.a/ 'inch, ounce', *puteus* /ˈpu.te.us/ 'well'
- CL /i e/ → VL /j/ when in hiatus
  - this has the effect of reducing the syllable count of VL words
  - it also creates the environment for rampant palatalisation (stay tuned...)
- CL *unciam* /ˈun.k<span class="emph">i</span>.ã/ 'inch, ounce' → VL /ˈon.k<span class="emph">j</span>a/ → /ˈon.tʃa/
  - It. *oncia*, Sp. *onza*, Po. *onça*, Fr. *once*
- CL *puteum* /ˈpu.t<span class="emph">e</span>.ũ/ 'well' → VL /ˈpo.t<span class="emph">j</span>o/ → /ˈpo.tso/
  - It. *pozzo*, Sp. *pozo*, Po. *poço*, Fr. *puits*

---

## Palatalisation

- one of the most striking differences in the consonant systems of CL and VL is the number of palatal consonants in VL
- these arose from the palatalisation of consonants preceding either:
  - the front vowels VL /i e ɛ/
  - or the glide VL /j/ (created out of CL /i e/ in hiatus)
- the velar stops CL /k ɡ/ palatalise before front vowels
- a wider array of consonants palatalise before /j/: CL /k ɡ t d n l/

---

## Palatalisation before front vowels

### CL /k/ → VL /tʃ/

- CL *centum* /ˈ<span class="emph">k</span>en.tũ/ 'hundred' → VL /ˈ<span class="emph">tʃ</span>ɛn.to/
  - It., Po; *cento*; Sp. *ciento*; Fr. *cent*

### CL /ɡ/ → VL /ʝ/

- CL *germānum* /<span class="emph">ɡ</span>erˈmaː.nũ/ 'of siblings (adj.)' → VL /<span class="emph">ʝ</span>erˈma.no/
  - It. *germano*, Sp. *hermano*, Po. *irmão*, Fr. *germain*

---

## Palatalisation before /j/

### CL /k/ → VL /tʃ/

- CL *unciam* /ˈun.<span class="emph">k</span>i.ã/ 'inch, ounce' → VL /ˈon.<span class="emph">kj</span>a/ → /ˈon.<span class="emph">tʃ</span>a/
  - It. *oncia*, Sp. *onza*, Po. *onça*, Fr. *once*

### CL /ɡ/ → VL /ʝʝ/

- note difference from how /ɡ/ palatalises before front vowels
- CL *corrigiam* /korˈri.<span class="emph">ɡ</span>i.ã/ 'leather strap' → VL /korˈre.<span class="emph">ɡj</span>a/ → /korˈre<span class="emph">ʝ.ʝ</span>a/
  - It. *coreggia*; Sp., Po. *correa*; Fr. *courroie*

---

## Palatalisation before /j/

### CL /t/ → VL /ts/

- CL *puteum* /ˈpu.<span class="emph">t</span>e.ũ/ 'well' → VL /ˈpo.<span class="emph">tj</span>o/ → /ˈpo.<span class="emph">ts</span>o/
  - It. *pozzo*, Sp. *pozo*, Po. *poço*, Fr. *puits*

### CL /d/ → VL /ʝʝ/

- CL *radium* /ˈra.<span class="emph">d</span>i.ũ/ 'ray' → VL /ˈra.<span class="emph">dj</span>o/ → /ˈra<span class="emph">ʝ.ʝ</span>o/
  - It. *raggio*, Sp. *rayo*, Po. *raio*

---

## Palatalisation before /j/

### CL /n/ → VL /ɲ/

- CL *seniōrem* /se.<span class="emph">n</span>iˈoː.rẽ/ 'older' → VL /seˈ<span class="emph">nj</span>o.re/ → /seˈ<span class="emph">ɲ</span>o.re/
  - It. *signore*, Sp. *señor*, Po. *senhor*, Fr. *seigneur*

### CL /l/ → VL /ʎ/

- CL *fīliam* /ˈfiː.<span class="emph">l</span>i.ã/ 'daughter' → VL /ˈfi.<span class="emph">lj</span>a/ → /ˈfi.<span class="emph">ʎ</span>a/
  - It. *figlia*, Sp. *hija*, Po. *filha*, Fr. *fille*


---

## Consonant cluster simplification

- many medial CL consonant clusters simplified to become geminates in VL
- one occurred even in educated speech: CL /ns/ was pronounced /s/
  - this also had the effect of lengthening the preceding vowel, so *mensem* would be pronounced as if it were *mēsem*
  - unlike the other cluster simplifications, this did not produce a geminate

### CL /ns/ → VL /s/

- CL *mensem* /ˈme<span class="emph">n.s</span>ẽ/ 'month' → /ˈmeː.<span class="emph">s</span>ẽ/ → VL /ˈme.<span class="emph">s</span>e/
  - It. *mese*, Sp. *mes*, Po. *mês*, Fr. *mois*

---

## Consonant cluster simplification

### CL /ps/ → VL /ss/

- CL *gypsum* /ˈgi<span class="emph">p.s</span>ũ/ 'plaster' → VL /ˈʝe<span class="emph">s.s</span>o/
  - It., Po. *gesso*; Sp. *yeso*

### CL /rs/ → VL /ss/

- CL *persicam* /ˈpe<span class="emph">r.s</span>i.kã/ 'Persian (fruit, i.e. peach)' → VL /ˈpɛ<span class="emph">s.s</span>e.ka/
  - It. *pesca*, Po. *péssega*, Fr. *pêche*

- CL *septem* /ˈse<span class="emph">p.t</span>ẽ/ 'seven' → VL /ˈsɛ<span class="emph">t.t</span>e/
  - It. *sette*, Sp. *siete*, Po. *sete*, Fr. *sept*

### CL /ksC/ → VL /sC/

- CL *extrāneum* /e<span class="emph">kˈs</span>traː.ne.ũ/ 'strange' → VL /e<span class="emph">s</span>ˈtra.ɲo/
  - It. *strano*, Sp. *extraño*, Po. *extranho*, Fr. *étrange*

## Word-initial /s/ clusters

- in CL, consonant clusters beginning in /s/ could begin a syllable, just like in English: *spērāre* 'to hope', *stare* 'to stand', *schola* 'school', etc.
- in VL, this was not a legitimate syllable structure
  - to repair this, they inserted a vowel (VL /e/) at the beginning of words to provide a syllable to hold the /s/

### CL /sC/ → VL /esC/

- CL *scholam* /ˈ<span class="emph">sk</span>o.lã/ 'school' → VL /<span class="emph">esˈk</span>ɔ.la/
  - It. *scuola*, Sp. *escuela*, Po. *escola*, Fr. *école*

## Word-final consonants

### CL /-Ṽ/ → VL /-Vn/ in frequent monosyllabic words

- in certain frequent monosyllabic words, orthographic final *-m*, which marked nasalisation, was realised as a nasal consonant VL /n/, e.g.:
  - CL *cum* /kũ/ 'with' → VL /kon/
  - CL *quam* /kʷã/ 'than' → VL /kʷan/
  - CL *quem* /kʷẽ/ 'who' → VL /kʷɛn/
  - CL *tam* /tã/ 'so' → VL /tan/

## Word-final consonants

### Consonants liable to loss

- many final consonants were dropped in Romance languages, but different languages dropped different ones
  - CL /-t/ was lost everywhere but Gaul 
  - CL /-d/ was lost everywhere
  - CL /-k/ was lost everywhere
  - CL /-s/ was lost only in Italy

## Word-final consonants

### CL /-Vr/ → VL /-rV/ 

- CL *semper* /ˈsem.p<span class="emph">er</span>/ 'always' → VL /ˈsɛm.p<span class="emph">re</span>/
  - It., Po. *sempre*; Sp. *siempre*
